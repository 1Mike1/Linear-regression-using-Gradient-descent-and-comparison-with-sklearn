# Linear-regression-using-Gradient-descent-and-comparison-with-sklearn
In this repo you will learn about linear regression and gradient descent, where i dint use "sklearn" to train and predict our data. I have just used gradient descent method to train and predict our dataset, also i have compared the sklearn output with gradient descent where you will notice a little difference in the output beacuse sklearn use "Least Squares solver".

# Requirements
pandas.
numpy.
matplotlib.
sklearn.

# Installation
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib sklearn
